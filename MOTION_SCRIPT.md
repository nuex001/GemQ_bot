Title: GemQ Motion Graphic — Full Script

Purpose: 60–90s motion graphic script that clearly explains what GemQ does, how to use it, and why it matters. Use this script as VO + on-screen captions and visual direction for the animator and voice actor.

Tone: Friendly, professional, confident. Short sentences, active verbs. Keep language tight and visual cues explicit.

Length target: 60–90 seconds (approx. 150–220 spoken words). Full script below — about 320 words with optional micro 30s cut included.

---

00–06s — Hook
Visual: Close-up on a smartphone chat screen. A glowing document icon and a bot avatar pop into view. Quick, energetic zoom.
VO: “Meet GemQ — your project assistant inside Telegram.”
On-screen: “GemQ — Project AI Assistant” (bold)

06–14s — Problem
Visual: Chaotic chat bubbles, lost files, a user scrolling frantically.
VO: “Project files get lost in long chats. Teams waste time searching for answers.”
On-screen: “Files get lost. Answers slow.”

14–28s — Private setup (simple demo)
Visual: Transition to clean private chat. User sends /start, types project name: “NeonPulse”, drags and drops a PDF into the chat.
VO: “Start privately: send /start, give a project name, and upload a PDF.”
On-screen: Step captions: “1. /start • 2. Project name • 3. Upload PDF”

28–36s — Confirmation & sharing
Visual: Bot replies with a clean confirmation card: “Project added • Share code: NEONPULSE” and a subtle success animation (checkmark).
VO: “GemQ stores your project and gives a short share code to link it to group chats.”
On-screen: “Project added • Share code: NEONPULSE”

36–56s — Group usage demo
Visual: Switch to group chat. A user mentions the bot: “@GemQ How long is the timeline?” Bot replies with a short, confident answer and a micro-callout: “(source: project.pdf — page 3).” Show token meter decreasing slightly.
VO: “Add GemQ to your team chat. Mention @GemQ or reply to any message to get instant, document-aware answers.”
On-screen: Example Q → A: “@GemQ How long is the timeline?” → “GemQ: 6 weeks (see page 3)”

56–70s — Safety & limits
Visual: Minimal icons: shield (privacy), meter (tokens), AI spark (Gemini). Token meter shows ‘500’ then minus usage.
VO: “Uploads are private; the bot uses tokens per query and Google Gemini to power responses.”
On-screen: “Secure • Private • Token-based • Gemini-powered”

70–82s — Tech snapshot
Visual: Simple diagram: Telegram ↔ GemQ (Express) ↔ MongoDB ↔ Google GenAI. Arrows for file flow: file_id → getFileLink → AI.
VO: “Built with Node.js, Telegraf, MongoDB and Google Gemini — lightweight and fast.”
On-screen: “Telegraf • Express • MongoDB • Google Gemini”

82–90s — CTA
Visual: Return to phone view. User smiles, types a message, and the bot responds. Final card with GitHub link and a short call to action.
VO: “Stop digging through chats. Upload a PDF, add GemQ to your group, and get answers instantly. Try GemQ today.”
On-screen: “Try GemQ now • GitHub: /nuex001/GemQ_bot”

Animation & VO notes
- Pace: brisk but not rushed. Use 2–4s micro-cuts for UI actions; 8–14s for the demo sequence.
- Visual style: clean UI mockups; contrast between messy chat (problem) and clean UI (solution).
- Micro-interactions: document hover, upload checkmark, token meter tick, short AI spark animation when generating answers.
- Accessibility: keep on-screen text large and high-contrast; include subtitles for VO.

Assets & copy snippets to reuse
- Project name example: “NeonPulse”
- Share code sample: “NEONPULSE”
- Success message sample (bot): “Project successfully added ✅\nShare code: NEONPULSE”
- Group question sample: “@GemQ How long is the timeline?”
- Bot reply sample: “GemQ: 6 weeks (see page 3)”
- Token note on-screen: “Tokens: 500”

Optional 30s executive cut (script lines ~90 words)
- VO: “Meet GemQ — your project assistant inside Telegram. Upload a PDF privately, get a short share code, add GemQ to your team chat, and mention @GemQ for instant, document-aware answers. Secure, private, and powered by Google Gemini. Try GemQ today.”
- On-screen key shots: hook, quick upload, confirmation card, group mention → reply, final CTA.

If you want, I can also:
- produce a 30-second storyboard PNG with labeled frames, or
- create caption-ready lines (12–16 concise lines) you can paste into your timeline.
