Title: GemQ — Project AI Assistant (Motion Graphic Brief)

Purpose
- A concise visual script and direction to showcase GemQ: a Telegram bot that turns project PDFs into on-demand AI-powered help inside group chats.
- Goal: explain value, how it works, and invite judges/customers to try it.
- Target length: 60–90 seconds (approx. 150–220 spoken words). Keep it clean, modern, and confident.

Tone & Style
- Friendly, professional, and slightly playful. Minimal UI, bold iconography, smooth transitions, and fast, readable on-screen copy.
- Color palette: #0b6cff (primary blue), #0f1724 (dark charcoal), #ffffff (white), #f3f6fb (light background), accent #00c4a7 (teal).
- Typography: Sans-serif, geometric (e.g., Inter or Poppins). Big headlines, concise subcopy.

Key messages (one-liners to use as section headers)
- "Upload a PDF. Share with your team. Get instant AI help in chat." (core value)
- "Private setup, group access, context-aware answers." (how it helps teams)
- "Fast, secure, and built for collaboration." (reassurance)

Scene-by-scene storyboard (timings & assets)
1) Hook (0–6s)
   - Visual: Quick animated phone / Telegram bubble popping with bot avatar and a glowing document icon.
   - VO: “Meet GemQ—your project assistant inside Telegram.”
   - On-screen text: “GemQ — Project AI Assistant”

2) Problem (6–14s)
   - Visual: A user scrolling through messy chat threads, looking for project files. Overlapping chat bubbles, lost PDF icon.
   - VO: “Finding project details in long chats wastes time.”
   - On-screen text: “Files get lost. Answers slow.”

3) Solution intro (14–25s)
   - Visual: Transition to a clean private chat with the bot. User taps /start, types a project name, drags a PDF into the chat.
   - VO: “Upload a PDF privately and GemQ indexes it for your team.”
   - On-screen text: “Private upload → Team access”

4) Confirmation & sharing (25–36s)
   - Visual: Bot replies with a clean confirmation card showing a short project code (e.g., NEONPULSE) and a ‘Share in group’ prompt.
   - VO: “Get a share code and add GemQ to your group to link the project.”
   - On-screen text: “Project added • Share code: NEONPULSE”

5) Group usage demo (36–55s)
   - Visual: In group chat, a user mentions the bot @GemQ and asks a short question. Bot responds with an AI-generated answer referencing the PDF (floating text callouts highlight ‘source: project.pdf’).
   - VO: “Mention GemQ in a group or reply to a message—get instant, context-aware answers from your PDF.”
   - On-screen text: “@GemQ How long is the timeline? → GemQ: 6 weeks (see page 3)”

6) Safety & limits (55–66s)
   - Visual: Clean icons for privacy, tokens (meter), and Gemini API (AI spark). Token meter shows 500 default and decreases when used.
   - VO: “Private setup, token-based usage, and secure AI powered by Google Gemini.”
   - On-screen text: “Secure • Private • Token-based”

7) Tech stack & how it works (66–78s)
   - Visual: Simple diagram: Telegram ↔ GemQ server (Express) ↔ MongoDB (projects) ↔ Google GenAI (Gemini). Show file flow: file_id → getFileLink → AI.
   - VO: “Built with Node.js, Telegraf, MongoDB and Gemini—fast and lightweight.”
   - On-screen text: “Telegraf • Express • MongoDB • Google Gemini”

8) Call to action (78–90s)
   - Visual: Return to the device, user smiling, quick text: “Try GemQ — upload a PDF and mention @GemQ in your group.”
   - VO: “Get more from your docs—try GemQ today.”
   - On-screen text: “Try it now • GitHub: /nuex001/GemQ_bot”

Voiceover script (short, punchy)
- “Meet GemQ, your project assistant inside Telegram. Stop digging through messy chats. Upload a PDF privately, get a share code, add GemQ to your group, and mention @GemQ for instant, document-aware answers. Secure, private, and powered by Google Gemini. Try it today.”

Visual assets to pull from the project
- Bot flow: show the `/start` flow (project name → PDF → confirmation). Use sample strings from live runs: project code, success copy.
- Project model: show tokens (default 500), chat linking, and file_id concept visually (no sensitive data exposed).
- Tech stack text and simple flow diagram (drawn, not taken from code). Code snippets are optional but keep legible and short if included.

On-screen text snippets (for motion graphics captions)
- “Upload a PDF privately.”
- “Get a share code — link to your group.”
- “Mention @GemQ in group chat for contextual answers.”
- “Tokens included: 500 (used per query)”
- “Built with Telegraf • Express • MongoDB • Google Gemini”

Timing & pacing notes
- Keep cuts tight: 2–4s per micro-action, 8–12s for demo sequences.
- Use micro-interactions (document hover, animated checkmark on upload, token meter animation) to keep motion engaging.

Accessibility & localization
- Keep text large (≥24px on mobile comps) and short. Voiceover script should have subtitles for clarity. Avoid color-only indicators (add icons and labels).

Possible extensions / two variants
- 30s executive cut: Hook + solution + CTA (best for pitch demos)
- 90s product demo: Full flow + tech diagram + token/security callout

Notes for the animator
- Keep backgrounds minimal and neutral; emphasize the Telegram chat window and floating cards.
- Use smooth easing, subtle overshoots for UI elements, and consistent corner radius across cards.
- Prefer vector icons and clean geometric shapes. Use 60–90 fps for micro-animations, 30 fps for final render.

Deliverable format
- 1920×1080 main render + 1080×1920 vertical cut for mobile socials.
- Provide a separate transcript file for captions and a short 30s version of the VO.

Word count of this brief: ~ 610 words

---

If you want, I can also generate:
- A 30-second micro script + storyboard compressed into 120 words; or
- A set of 12 caption-ready lines you can drop into the timeline.

Which of those would help you next?
